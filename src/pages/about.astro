	<p>
		I am Raphael, a relentless problem solver, product builder, and software engineer obsessed with efficiency, autonomy, and innovation. From an early age, I found myself drawn to the challenge of turning abstract ideas into tangible, high-impact solutions, an obsession that led me to start programming at just 14 years old. My work is not just about writing code—it's about engineering change, about dissecting inefficiencies and creating practical, scalable solutions that function in the real world, not just on paper.

		I thrive in the chaotic trenches of startup building, where structure is fluid, execution is king, and ideas either ship or die. I have built products that operate at the intersection of finance, technology, and human behavior. My ventures are self-sufficient, lean, and built for scale, proving that a well-executed idea is far more powerful than a heavily-funded one with no product-market fit.

		<h3>What I Build</h3>
		My core philosophy is simple: if it’s broken, fix it—fast, lean, and profitably. That’s the foundation of every company I’ve built:<br><br>

		MySub – A fintech platform solving payment splitting in West Africa, where financial collaboration is hindered by outdated banking systems. Today, MySub has over 360,000 users and a growing monthly recurring revenue, without a single cent of outside investment.<br><br>
		OwoFi – An offline money transfer system designed for regions without reliable internet infrastructure. Built to function where conventional fintech apps fail.<br><br>
		TrustShield.app – An AI-powered threat detection and neutralization system that operates in real time, integrating machine learning for autonomous security analysis.<br><br>
		AristoMan – A men’s self-care brand challenging societal norms around masculinity and grooming. Every product is scientifically formulated, a deviation from the gimmick-heavy men’s grooming industry.<br><br>
		and many more<br><br>

		<h3>How I Think</h3>
		I believe in velocity, iteration, and survival-driven execution. Many founders overthink and under-build—I do the opposite. I ship early, embrace friction, and let the market dictate the next move. This mindset has allowed me to build products that people actually use, rather than ones that look good in pitch decks.<br><br>

		My work is heavily influenced by systems thinking, behavioral economics, and historical trends. The human mind is a predictable machine, shaped by incentives, survival instincts, and cultural conditioning. Understanding these mechanics allows me to build products that integrate seamlessly into how people already behave, rather than forcing change.<br><br>

		I also write, not because I enjoy it, but because it forces me to clarify my thinking. My blog on Substack is where I process, refine, and express my raw, often contrarian views on technology, startups, power structures, and the human condition.

		<h3>Where I’m Headed</h3>
		Building products that work for emerging economies is my core mission. The world is shifting—Africa is rising, and the infrastructure for its digital economy is still being built. I want to be at the forefront of that revolution.<br><br>

		I am also expanding my strategic and business acumen through an MBA, as a way to refine my understanding of scale, finance, and global markets. Long-term, I aim to create and invest in products that fundamentally alter economic participation in emerging markets—not as charity, but as pure, survival-driven capitalism.<br><br>

		If you're building something interesting, have a contrarian take on the future, or just want to debate ideas, let’s connect.
