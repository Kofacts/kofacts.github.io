dec, 2022. i was visiting a close friend, and my co-founder and i spent a few afternoons watching the friction of people trying to move in the same direction. whether it was pooling money for a rental or trying to coordinate a dinner bill without a dozen screenshots and verbal promises, the process was broken. it was a lot of human energy spent on something that should have been invisible.</p><p>the first version of the app was built in three days. we used to joke that we could move from an idea to a functional mvp in the time it took most people to send a calendar invite. my co-founder is celeriously adroit with fleshing out systems, and i have a sort of mind-muscle memory for user flows that lets me bypass the usual second-guessing. when we get into that rhythm, the distance between thinking of a tool and actually using it just disappears. in the beginning, the momentum felt effortless.</p><p>that first year was bliss. we hit profitability early, and for a while, the thing we built was actually solving the problem we&#8217;d seen in nairobi. but v1 was strictly us testing the waters. we wanted mysub to be the default infrastructure for shared finances, which meant eventually moving to v2. we wanted to open the platform up so others could manage their own bill-splitting and resource pooling.</p><p>there was a lot of skepticism about that transition. we had something that worked and was making money, so the push to change it felt counterintuitive. it reminded me of the apple philosophy of keeping everything closed and controlled, but the goal for mysub was always for it to be used by others, not just managed by us. v2 was the realization of that, even if it meant giving up the simplicity of the early days.</p><p>then the reality of the environment caught up. it is hard to describe the &#8220;<em>stochasticism</em>&#8221; of trying to track profit and loss when the ground is constantly shifting. we were reporting earnings to investors in dollars while our customers paid in naira. watching the rate move from 400 to 1300 was a different kind of pressure. i remember being at a basketball court, looking at the numbers on my phone, and feeling the sheer weight of it. no one predicts that kind of volatility. it throws your balance off in a way that no amount of efficacious structuring can fix.</p><p>this week, a private company acquired mysub. as part of that transition, the product is now defunct.</p><p>the finality of it has been quiet. i&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks buried in the business operations of an ending. my days were consumed by the ledgers. we had to make sure every seller was settled and every buyer with unused funds received their refund. we added a little extra for some of our sellers, a small acknowledgement of the time they spent with us. i was mostly just excited that we could handle the closing off this way, without the usual chaos. there is a specific, repetitive labor in winding down a company. it is a lot of bank reconciliations and manual verifications, ensuring that when the lights go out, the books are perfectly balanced to zero.</p><p>i&#8217;ve realized that the real work of a founder isn&#8217;t just the three-day sprints or the initial rush of traction. it is the stewardship that follows. once you are responsible for other people&#8217;s money, the project stops being about your own curiosity and starts being about the promises you&#8217;ve made. there is a relief in knowing we kept those promises all the way to the last day. we didn&#8217;t just walk away. we did the accounting.</p><p>what happens to the product now is no longer mine to decide. what happens next to me is.</p><p>lately, i&#8217;ve been sitting at my desk without any specific urgency. i&#8217;m dabbling in some algorithmic trading and running small ai experiments, mostly just poking at models and logic to see how they respond. it is not a new venture or a pivot per se. there is no particular roadmap or positioning. i am just enjoying the feeling of being curious about a system without having to worry about how it scales or who is waiting on a payout. it has been a long time since i built something just to see if it would work.</p><p>the accounts are settled. the balances are at zero. that&#8217;s enough.</p><p>onward.</p>"},{"title":"tyranny of the small

ourselves busy. It is the reflexive reply, the badge of belonging, the safest way to account for a day without having to examine it too closely. I reckon that the claim is a deception. Our exhaustion is not the result of thinking at the edge of our ability. It is the slow, corrosive buildup of small, ceaseless obligations. That exact accumulation, not intellectual effort, has become the true, corrosive signature of our working lives.</p><p>Most days do not collapse under the weight of difficult problems. They dissolve instead. We move from one minor mandate to the next; responding, acknowledging, rescheduling, confirming. By evening, the calendar is full, yet we cannot point to an output proportionate to the attention consumed.</p><p>We are not executing complex tasks; we are operating as the human lubricant for systems that are unable to sustain themselves. Our attention is devoured not by the substance of the work, but by the choreography surrounding it. The confirmations. The scheduling rituals. The repeated cycles of validation. We spend our days administering friction that should not require administration. The mind is stretched thin.</p><p>This condition is not a personal failure to be honest. It is a structural failure of design. Work has been systematically fractured into units so trivial, so conditional, and so numerous that they mandate constant human presence while demanding almost no human thought. These tasks must be settled, but they do not deserve the time of a sentient being.</p><div><hr></div><p>The infrastructure of modern assistance has offered no true liberation either. Its innovations are largely acts of relocation. The effort is shifted from a voice call to a shared link, from a long thread to a ticketing system. The work itself does not vanish. It is merely repackaged, relabeled, and presented behind a new dashboard. Progress is claimed, but the core burden persists.</p><p>The individual is not freed; the individual is conscripted into maintenance. We are now responsible for configuring, teaching, and auditing the very tools meant to lighten the load. We live inside systems that require the mind to first decompose intention into atomic steps, translate purpose into precise commands, and then stand guard against the inevitable failure. I wouldn&#8217;t consider this delegation. It is dictation with better branding. The entire gravity of context and final authority remains anchored to the human consciousness.</p><p>This arrangement produces a persistent injury: it forces the thinking mind to hover over work that does not require thought. To understand the depth of this drain, we must separate the kinds of effort we conflate.</p><p>There is Creation: The domain of judgment, synthesis, and original thought. The capacity to recognize the unstated problem, to forge the non-obvious connection, or to impose coherence where none existed before. This work commands attention because it justifies the expenditure.</p><p>And then there is Alignment: The domain of compliance, verification, and endless confirmation. Ensuring the format is correct. Confirming the attachment is present. Transcribing data from one vessel to another. Waiting for acknowledgment, then checking again. This labor is essential to the system&#8217;s momentum, yet it is utterly degrading to the mind performing it. It is the work of a mechanism, performed by a person.</p><div><hr></div><p>For decades, we tried to automate this connective tissue with fixed logic. Rigid rules and brittle flows fractured instantly under the subtle, constant volatility of human collaboration. The effort required to maintain these systems routinely exceeded the effort they saved. When the mechanism failed, the human; adaptable, cheap, and always available - was pushed back into the breach.</p><p>From this chronic failure emerged an unspoken, pervasive mandate: that all necessary labor must be supervised labor. If a task holds consequence, we assume it must be watched, initiated, and approved by a thinking mind at every step. This belief has become so normalized it is invisible. Yet it is the single greatest drain on our vitality - the low, constant hum of trivial checking that prevents the mind from ever achieving the quiet necessary for depth.</p><div><hr></div><p>The shift that is coming will not arrive through faster interfaces or richer dashboards. That is merely the old architecture, accelerated.</p><p>The true change lies in the systemic withdrawal of the thinking mind from the duty of perpetual supervision. It requires a capability that can carry the full weight of intent forward without requiring continuous human presence. Not systems that wait for commands, but functions that understand an objective and manage the necessary alignment without demanding attention at every juncture. This would not be the arrival of just another tool. It is the disappearance of an entire stratum of effort.</p><p>The mind must be freed from the low, ceaseless friction of coordinating its own intentions.</p><p>We are left, then, with an unsettling question: If a vast category of labor exists that is necessary for the system, trivial to execute, and yet exhausting to supervise, what happens to the meaning of our professional lives when the demand for constant human vigilance is finally lifted?<br><br>*****</p><p>Currently immersed in Will Durant&#8217;s <em>The Story of Philosophy</em>. It&#8217;s a vast, sprawling work, and I find myself pulled by caprice through various thinkers and eras. I hope to eventually distill these disparate observations into a focused lucubration once I&#8217;ve turned the final page.<br></p>"},{"title":"performative

deep, solitary conviction, but from choreography. For years, I bristled at the observed gap; the sense that what I saw was less an authentic truth and more a rehearsed script. It felt like a fundamental compromise. Yet, I&#8217;ve come to realize that this very <em>performativity</em> does not cheapen it; it is what renders it structurally sound.</p><p>We perform goodness long before we can truly understand good. The child mimics kindness before grasping the complex texture of virtue. The novice practices the ritual before believing in the doctrine beneath it.</p><p>This performance plays out constantly: watch people in a difficult meeting, choosing their words with unnatural care, borrowing gestures of humility or authority, adhering to unspoken rules of consensus. See the small, reflexive apology offered when a foot is stepped on, a response inherited from a social script, more theatrical than a deeply felt theological urge toward repentance. It is this daily, public enactment, this borrowing of scripts - that establishes the ethical floor of a community.</p><h3>**</h3><p>I&#8217;ve always been drawn to radical inquiry; this relentless urge to pry open every assumption and interrogate the roots. I still believe it&#8217;s a noble impulse, but it carries a terrible cost. Pure questioning is not a sustainable philosophy; it is a solvent. Hear me out.</p><p>You cannot build a civilization on acid.</p><p>No stable arrangement of humans can survive if everyone is perpetually committed to deconstruction. Someone has to agree to stop questioning long enough to build something. I used to feel profound frustration, bordering on intellectual loneliness, with those who avoided this constant turbulence. Now, I see them choosing a different wisdom: the wisdom of stability. They seek a navigable life. The structures we inherit; religious, cultural, ethical - are engineered precisely for this massive, essential need.</p><p>Not everyone needs root access to the human condition.</p><h3>**</h3><p>This shift led me to view moral systems as the user interface <em>to</em> the machine. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Conceptual Framing</strong>: In a technical depiction, the human substrate, a chaotic tangle of fear, desire, ego, and raw tribal calculus - functions as the <strong>Backend</strong>. Moral systems act as the <strong>Abstraction Layer</strong>, providing the essential <strong>User Interface</strong>. This UI surfaces only the prescribed controls required for <strong>cooperative functionality</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>The backend is messy. Morality is the abstraction layer. It surfaces only the controls - the prescribed responses and simplified choices we need to press to remain humane. This is precisely why performative morality holds its value; many interact with ethics the same way they navigate complex software: through the simplest, visible fa&#231;ade.</p><p>And we cannot fault the user for ignoring the dense logic of the source code.</p><h3>***</h3><p>I scoff(ed) at people living by &#8220;What would Jesus do?&#8221; or subsisting on aphoristic Stoic snippets. I assumed true virtue had to be self-derived, original, and hard-won. This, I&#8217;ve realized, is a <em>romantic fantasy</em>. The truth is, we all borrow our virtues. We all inherit our ethics. We all imitate our way into character.</p><p>There is no shame in moral mimicry. The inherited structure often demonstrates greater resilience than the improvised one. Why would you reinvent a protocol that already works under stress, simply for the sake of originality? Coherence is the actual goal. Stability is the prize.</p><p>At its core, morality, even when performed, serves one civilizational purpose: it <strong>mitigates entropy</strong>. The morality does not need to be metaphysically true; it needs only to work. Civilization requires people who hesitate before acting, not enlightened saints.</p><h3>****</h3><p>I&#8217;ve spent the better part of the year submerged in ethics, searching for some primal, unsullied origin of morality. Instead, I found an artefact. Its metaphysics may be foggy, but its ripple effect is concrete.</p><p>Fair to say that my perspective finally ensconced when I held it against my own practice as an engineer. I spend hours writing documentation, creating predictable patterns, and building onboarding flows and decision logs for my team. The elegance of the structure is irrelevant. What matters is its ability to reduce chaos, make decisions repeatable, and allow the next person to function without burning the system down.</p><p>**</p><p>This reflection on performance and structure is not intended as a call for intellectual quietism btw (haha). It is not an argument against the necessary impulse to question injustice or inertia either. I still believe that the radical act of inquiry is vital for progress - it just cannot be the <em>only</em> act.</p>"},{"title":"ụlọ uche","link":"https://obodugo.substack.com/p/ulo-uche","date":"Sun, 09 Nov 2025 07:37:32 GMT","slug":"l-uche","description":"the library was a small room above the art club.","content":"<p>the library was a small room above the art club. its windows were narrow, the paint around them already flaking. the air always smelled like dust and wood polish, and the fan hummed without much conviction. it wasn&#8217;t the kind of place anyone rushed to, which was probably why i liked it. during break periods, when the compound filled with shouting and the clatter of basketball kicks, i climbed the stairs there. it wasn&#8217;t planned; one day i just walked in and didn&#8217;t stop going.</p><p>college of immaculate conception in enugu had a reputation. parents said it was the best school in the east. i hadn&#8217;t asked to go there, but children rarely get consulted on such things. i&#8217;d topped the common entrance exam, first among seven hundred. on inauguration day, i remember parents pairing their children with me, as if being near the boy with the best score might be contagious. i smiled, said little, and tried not to look as confused as i felt.</p><p>the school itself was a machine. there were routines, bells, orders barked in the name of discipline. seniors ruled like minor gods. some were cruel, others indifferent, all convinced that authority was something you proved through noise. i wasn&#8217;t made for it. i learned to stay out of sight.</p><p>the library helped with that. it was quiet enough to hear yourself think, which felt like a luxury. i didn&#8217;t go there to study for exams. i read whatever i found. zoology was my favourite then. there was a book with a lavish cover, full of drawings of strange animals. i liked tracing the outlines with my eyes. sometimes i read about the biafran war, sometimes about faraway countries. i wasn&#8217;t gathering facts tbh; i was just keeping company with the pages.</p><p>when the bell rang, everything dissolved. boys rushed past, voices rose again, and the calm folded in on itself. i would walk back to class, half present, half still inside the quiet.</p><p>i didn&#8217;t fit into the idea of a &#8220;good student.&#8221; attendance mattered more than understanding, and i often skipped classes that bored me. <em>agangwu</em> became my comfort space. at the slightest inconvenience, i found myself heading there, sometimes out of frustration, other times out of habit. it&#8217;s funny now to think that <em>agangwu</em> was almost a literal place of convenience.</p><p>i liked figuring things out on my own, in no particular order. later, when i picked up a book on q basic and taught myself to code, it felt like returning to that same rhythm; learning without permission.</p><p>the library didn&#8217;t rescue me from anything. i would have been fine without it. but it gave texture to my days, something that belonged to me. it wasn&#8217;t escape in hindsight; it was space. that&#8217;s the difference.</p><p>if i ever build one now, it&#8217;ll be a physical library. not a digital archive or a study hub, but a room with real books and open chairs. students could walk in and follow their curiosity wherever it leads - philosophy, mathematics, mechanics, poetry. no curriculum, no supervision. just the chance to stumble on something that holds their attention.</p><p>i&#8217;d call it <em>&#7909;l&#7885; uche</em>, the house of thought.</p><p>a place that holds what the classroom often forgets: the quiet urge to understand, even when no one is watching.</p>"},{"title":"priced belief","link":"https://obodugo.substack.com/p/priced-belief","date":"Sat, 11 Oct 2025 09:38:28 GMT","slug":"priced-belief","description":"The internet's first act was turning private thought into public content.

Its second, more radical turn is here: prediction markets are gutting that content and replacing it with <strong>conviction</strong>. We're not just building financial instruments; we are creating a new media substrate, a protocol for belief where you express your worldview not with a keyboard, but with capital.</p><p>The old web was a space of infinite, zero-cost opinions. It rewarded volume and outrage. The new web imposes a cost structure on rhetoric, asking: Do you believe it enough to bet on it?</p><p>This system of conviction is already segmenting itself into a supposed three vectors:</p><p>1. The Formal Gauge (Kalshi): This is the high-fidelity, regulated layer. It takes the biggest questions&#8212;recessions, election outcomes, climate shifts&#8212;and strips them down to an exchange-traded contract. It's the market as an institution, pricing systemic probability with Wall Street rigor. It makes information efficient, but keeps the risk contained.</p><p>2. The Global Protocol (Polymarket): This is the insurgent layer. Built on crypto, it's global, borderless, and permissionless. It proves the technology can run hot, taking a market from zero to millions in volume on a viral tweet or an unfolding crisis. It doesn&#8217;t ask for permission; it simply prices the world, offering a real-time, financially-backed truth signal on everything from presidential debates to SpaceX launches.</p><p>3. The Cultural Mutation (Gistpool): This is where the system begins to breathe. Gistpool is not a tidy third layer; it&#8217;s the chaotic emergence of the market as a social utility. It&#8217;s where markets turn into tradeable memes. The distinction between gossip, entertainment, and politics dissolves into a single stream of tradable narratives. When you bet on a celebrity&#8217;s next move or a cultural trend, you&#8217;re not making a financial hedge; you are performing an identity. You&#8217;re posting with money. The market price reflects not just probability, but cultural gravity.</p><p><strong>The New Media Loop</strong></p><p>In this architecture, the fundamental unit of communication shifts. The old media loop was: Information /  Attention /  Revenue.</p><p>The prediction market loop is cleaner, more brutal: Information / Conviction /  Price.</p><p>Here, attention is the new liquidity. The more a story grips the cultural mind, the deeper the market for its outcome becomes. The market is not merely commenting on the news; it is aggregating the distributed information advantage of the crowd, then synthesizing that into a single, continuously updated probability. It lets us price truth in real time, not based on editorial consensus or algorithmic reach, but on the aggregate conviction of participants.</p><p>Social media turned opinions into content. Prediction markets are turning content into accountability.</p><p>We are now faced with a system where the most efficient way to express belief is to assume financial risk. This is the ultimate skin-in-the-game media. It doesn&#8217;t allow you the cheap satisfaction of a like or an angry comment; it asks you to own your forecast. The trade is the post; the stake is the signal.</p><p>The price on the screen is not merely an indicator. It is the real-time expression of our collective, weighted, and wagered belief about the future. And it&#8217;s already built. The irreversible change is not a coming innovation; it is the silent, ongoing mutation of public discourse into a global trading floor. We've introduced friction back into the information economy. The conversation is now a contract.</p>"},{"title":"decadence is apathy","link":"https://obodugo.substack.com/p/decadence-is-apathy","date":"Mon, 22 Sep 2025 08:01:41

I last returned to this space. In that time, much has changed, but one theme has followed me everywhere: the cultivation - and protection - of taste.</p><p>I once called this piece &#8220;The Ripple Effect of Incompetence.&#8221; Because incompetence never ends with the task botched or the deadline missed. It creeps deeper, corroding one's very sense of judgment. Spend too long amid mediocrity and your palate dulls. The crooked wall looks straight. The lazy paragraph reads sufficient. The buggy product passes for serviceable. What is lost is not simply quality, but the instinct to recognize quality in the first place.</p><p>That is why incompetence is so dangerous. Once it colonizes taste, ambition shrinks. The bar lowers without anyone noticing. Organizations, teams, even whole societies become content with &#8220;good enough,&#8221; and worse, forget that better was ever possible. This is decadence in its truest form: not corruption, not vice, but <strong>apathy toward excellence</strong>.</p><p>By contrast, competence is more than output. It is discernment refined to a sharp edge. It is a cultivated impatience with &#8220;almost.&#8221; It is the capacity to feel when something is off, even when others no longer notice. Competence, at its highest expression, is taste.</p><p>I have been particular about this across every venture I have built. MySub, AristoMan, GistPool - different sectors, different audiences, yet bound by the same precept: if I cannot be enthused by what I have made, then it is not worth making.</p><p>Take AristoMan. It is not a software product. But I was obsessive over every contour of its design. The way the bottle sits in the hand, the weight of the cap, the typography on the label. I wanted to feel something when I received the product myself. I wanted to look at it and know, without hesitation, that this was built with care. The product was for me first, because if it could not excite me, it would not excite anyone.</p><p>This has always served as a corollary to my life. I build the thing I want, the thing I would use, the thing that makes me restless when it falls short. I like to think I have an eye for well-designed products, and because I espouse that dictum, whatever I gestate will inevitably exude the same omen.</p><h3>The Psychology of Apathy</h3><p>This principle is not cosmetic; it is existential. Competence is contagious. When you encounter something built with care - a product, a book, a service - you awaken to your own appetite for quality. You realize that you had settled for mediocrity without even knowing it. And once you have tasted competence, you cannot easily return.</p><p>But the opposite is a slow poison. Constant exposure to the half-finished, the sloppy, and the merely functional dulls our senses. We begin to normalize failure. We start to internalize a narrative that says, \"this is just how things are.\" This is not a rational conclusion, but a psychological capitulation. We stop seeing the possibility of a different reality because our everyday experience reinforces a bleak one. This is not just about the work we consume; it is about the work we produce. The bar we set for others becomes the bar we hold for ourselves.</p><h3>Building as Rebellion</h3><p>The great builders understood this. Jobs raged at circuit boards no one would see. Hegel scorned diluted philosophy and wrote in thunder instead. Their intolerance looked extreme, but extremity was the only defense against entropy. Had they compromised taste, all else would have collapsed.</p><p>Every act of real creation, then, is a rebellion. It is a defiant stand against the ambient apathy that surrounds us. To build with care is to reject the narcotic of &#8220;good enough.&#8221; It is an act of faith - faith in one&#8217;s own vision and in the potential for others to recognize and appreciate it. This is why the first user of any great product must be the creator themselves. The product must solve a problem you feel, must delight you, and must meet a standard you are unwilling to compromise on. The moment you build solely for an external audience, you risk losing that internal compass of taste.</p><p>This is not a matter of sector or scale; it is about spirit. Whether fintech, skincare, or prediction markets, the demand is the same: to build something that preserves my own palate, something that does not make me shrug when I receive it but makes me feel, yes, this is right.</p><h3>The Lethality of Compromise</h3><p>The alternative is easier, but lethal: to adapt to mediocrity until you no longer feel its sting. To let incompetence shape your taste until you stop desiring excellence at all. That path ends in torpor-in organizations that coast, in societies that stagnate, in individuals who forget what greatness even feels like. It is a slow, silent surrender of the soul.</p><p>Every act of real creation, then, is a refusal to surrender. To cultivate taste is to protect the soil where competence can grow. It is not just about the work itself, but about the world such work makes possible.</p><p>And so I return to this dictum: I build for myself first. I demand that the work I touch enthuse me, stir me, sharpen me. For once I lose that taste, once I compromise on competence, nothing I make will matter - not to me, not to anyone.</p>"},{"title":"a mathematician’s apology;

up a book about mathematics and find a cri de c&#339;ur about life, legacy, and the twilight of a brilliant mind. A Mathematician's Apology by G.H. Hardy is less a defense of a discipline and more a soul-baring confession from a man wrestling with his own obsolescence. It's a book that hits you in the gut, a relic from a different age that somehow feels intensely, uncomfortably modern.</p><p>I first read this book years ago, in that flush of youthful intellectualism when every idea felt like a revelation. An even greater kind of ardor that Hardy describes for his own work, a pure and unadulterated passion for something beautiful and true. He talks about math not as a tool but as an art form, a space for the creation of beautiful, permanent ideas. He elevates it, giving it a nobility that transcends utility. \"The mathematician's patterns,\" he writes, \"like the painter's or the poet's, must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way.\"</p><p>But the beauty is not all. There's a defensive undercurrent that runs through the entire text, a sense of a man bracing against the world's indifference. He's not just apologizing for a life spent on abstract pursuits; he's justifying it, almost to himself. He dismisses applied mathematics with a sneer, a purist's disdain for anything that might be useful. The work of a great mathematician, he insists, is \"of no practical use whatever.\" This is where the tension begins to fray. It's a bold claim, born of a certain aristocratic detachment - a refusal to engage with the messy, utilitarian world. It's an act of defiance, a kind of intellectual retreat into a fortress of pure thought.</p><p>And then there's the contradiction. Hardy claims his book is for the layman, a window into the mind of a mathematician. But as he progresses, he slips into a language that is anything but accessible. He talks about theorems, proofs, and principles in a way that assumes a familiarity with the terrain. He can't help himself. The obsession is too deep. It's like watching someone try to explain a dream: the emotions are clear, but the details are a jumble, a coded language that only they can truly understand.</p><p>The beauty of Hardy's Apology isn't in its clarity, but in its struggle. It's the record of a man trying to reconcile his life's work with the dawning awareness of his own mortality. It's the lament of a purist in a world that increasingly values results over elegance. He writes with a sense of poignant melancholy, a quiet sadness for the things he's lost and the things he's never had. It&#8217;s a book for anyone who has ever poured their heart into an idea, only to wonder, as the years go by, what it was all for. It's a reminder that passion, in its purest form, is both a blessing and a cage.</p><p>What are you currently reading?</p>"},{"title":"the esoteric machine","link":"https://obodugo.substack.com/p/the-esoteric-machine","date":"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 14:38:59 GMT","slug":"the-esoteric-machine","description":"i&#8217;ve been spending time in my head with apple.","content":"<p>i&#8217;ve been spending time in my head with apple. the actual structure of the company. the thinking behind it. how it has come to represent more than just hardware or software.</p><p>it started after reading isaacson&#8217;s biography on steve jobs. i didn&#8217;t come away inspired. the feeling was something closer to discomfort. the way apple makes decisions isn&#8217;t just technical. it is ideological. it is deliberate. and it works so well that most people don&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re agreeing to it.</p><p>jobs talked a lot about privacy. but what he meant wasn&#8217;t control in the hands of the user. he meant trust. his view was that users shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about what&#8217;s happening in the background. the company should take care of that. and apple became the company that promised to do so.</p><p>over time, people accepted that promise. they didn&#8217;t question it. the products were clean. they worked. software improved. hardware became harder to access. eventually, the entire relationship between people and their devices changed. users weren&#8217;t meant to explore anymore. they were meant to stay inside the experience that was designed for them.</p><p>what apple offered in return was ease. no clutter. no confusion. no complexity. but also no real access. the system was shaped so that the surface was enough. users stopped thinking about what else might exist beneath it.</p><p>on the outside, this looks like simplicity. but it is also containment. not through restriction alone, but through design that discourages curiosity. things just work. things are just there. and because the experience feels smooth, people stop asking questions.</p><p>i still use apple products. i like how quiet they are. how little they ask of me. and maybe that&#8217;s what i find troubling. they work so smoothly that it becomes easy to stop noticing how much is being decided on my behalf.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think it is about laziness. it&#8217;s about what we are willing to trade. we let go of certain things to gain others. we give up control so things don&#8217;t break. we accept limits so we can avoid friction. and the truth is, the exchange feels fair most of the time.</p><p>but the cost is harder to measure. we lose the habit of questioning. not because we are forbidden to, but because nothing invites it. there is no signal that something is missing. everything works, so everything feels complete.</p><p>i&#8217;ve been thinking about what that means for how we design systems. when we remove tension, we also remove opportunities for people to engage more deeply. when we make things too smooth, there is no reason to pause. and without that pause, nothing gets examined.</p><p>maybe that&#8217;s the quiet risk. not that people lose access, but that they stop noticing it was ever something they could want.</p>"},{"title":"cogito","link":"https://obodugo.substack.com/p/cogito","date":"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:59:21 GMT","slug":"cogito","description":"i stole this title from a tweet - think it had something to do with the launch of gpt, or something greg brockman had espoused for the name. funny to think gpt could&#8217;ve been called cogito. haha.","content":"<p>&#8220;Put your money where your mouth is.&#8221;<br>A phrase I used to take lightly; even find amusing - but over time lost its punch.

national technology</strong></p><p>mussolini knew something we don&#8217;t &#8212; that every truly great civilization runs not on gold, or oil, or population, but on myth. on the divine madness of

what you&#8217;re becoming. only that stasis is a form of failure.</p><p>this lie hides under motivational quotes and self-help. it wears the face of &#8220;healing.&#8221; but underneath it is the fear that if we ever paused&#8212;truly paused&#8212;we&#8217;d see ourselves as we are, not as we hope to appear.</p><p>so we tell ourselves we are growing. even when we are circling.</p><p>even when

we feel like we are. we remember our intentions, not our impact. we recall the one time we gave, not the many times we turned away.</p><p>we believe our moods are justice.</p><p>if we feel bad after doing something wrong, surely that&#8217;s proof we&#8217;re moral.</p><p>but the truth is: most people are only as good as their consequences allow.</p><p>and in the absence of consequence, they become themselves.</p><p></p><p><strong>allegory: the house of necessary lies</strong></p><p></p><p>imagine a house.</p><p>each room is supported by a single lie.</p><p></p><p>the kitchen stands

aurelius to seneca and couldn&#8217;t get past the fifth page. you could feel the concomitant opportunism in every line, the carefully measured restraint of a man who speaks not from conviction, but from convenience.</p><p>you see, the thing about winning is that it&#8217;s a theory&#8212;a vantage point we often try to ignore. to win is to assume a position of abstracted wisdom, to pontificate about struggle in past tense, to frame hardship as a mere lesson rather than a lived, suffocating reality. aurelius had won. seneca had won. and once you&#8217;ve won, the world takes on a different hue&#8212;pain becomes poetic, suffering turns instructive, and suddenly, the miseries of life are something to meditate on, rather than fight against.</p><p>but let&#8217;s be honest&#8212;what is stoicism if not the most elegant form of submission? aurelius, the emperor-philosopher, spoke not as a man trying to survive, but as one who had the privilege to reflect on survival. his words drip with the slow, patient arrogance of a man who has never been truly desperate, who has never had to scrape for existence, who has never felt the humiliation of powerlessness.</p><p>and seneca&#8212;what do you even say about a man who amassed grotesque wealth while writing essays on renouncing it? who wrote to kings about restraint while gorging himself on excess? there is something particularly vile about a man who profits from both ends of morality, who indulges in the very pleasures he condemns, only to retreat into philosophy when questioned.</p><p></p><p><strong>stoicism as slave morality</strong></p><p>nietzsche saw through it. in on the genealogy of morals, he dissects how morality itself has been weaponized as a tool of the weak, a self-imposed leash to keep the resentful, the powerless, and the downtrodden from ever rising. stoicism, in his view, was a form of slave morality, a way for those who could not seize power to make a virtue out of their inability to do so.</p><p>but make no mistake&#8212;stoicism was never meant for the rulers. aurelius may have written meditations on detachment, but he still waged wars. seneca may have mused on self-restraint, but he still accumulated obscene wealth. their philosophy, their so-called wisdom, was always meant to pacify those beneath them, to make suffering seem noble rather than unjust, to make detachment from struggle seem wise rather than cowardly.</p><p></p><p><strong>stoicism: the perfect tool for control</strong></p><p>this is why stoicism thrives today. because it is useful. not in the sense of making life better, but in making people complacent. in an era where people are exploited, underpaid, overworked, and told to be grateful for it, stoicism teaches  to accept rather

not necessarily in the shallow, political sense, but in a much deeper, more primal way&#8212;a preference for the known over the unknown, the predictable over the uncertain, the past over the future<strong>.</strong> we tell ourselves that we are agents of progress, but at our core, we resist rupture.</p><p>we romanticize lost traditions, clutch onto rituals that have outlived their utility, and construct golden ages in our heads&#8212;<strong>a past that never truly existed.</strong> even revolutions, the supposed destroyers of conservatism, only replace one ossified system with another. today&#8217;s radical is tomorrow&#8217;s reactionary.</p><p>but where does this conservatism come from? is it a biological safeguard for survival? or is it just an elaborate rationalization&#8212;<strong>a defense mechanism for those who benefit from things staying the same?</strong> if the essence of life is change, why do we fight so hard to pretend otherwise?</p><p></p><p><strong>ii. evolution made us conservative</strong></p><p>before we built civilizations, before we wrote laws, we were prey. survival depended on <strong>caution, repetition, and fear of the unknown.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>the status quo bias:</strong> what has worked before must work again.</p><p>&#8226; <strong>loss aversion:</strong> losing what you have is more terrifying than gaining something new is exciting.</p><p>&#8226; <strong>religion and tradition:</strong> designed to preserve order, obedience, and continuity, they transform past wisdom into <strong>unchallengeable truths.</strong></p><p></p><p>what started as <strong>an evolutionary instinct</strong>&#8212;to protect ourselves from uncertainty&#8212;became a doctrine. a framework. a moral system.</p><p></p><p><strong>iii. the myth of modern conservatism</strong></p><p>if conservatism was once a biological advantage, today it has become a selective ideology, wielded for convenience<strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p>&#8226; <strong>capitalists demand free markets but resist wealth redistribution.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>politicians glorify tradition but discard inconvenient parts of history.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>western nations claim to spread &#8220;civilized values&#8221; while erasing others&#8217; traditions.</strong></p><p>modern conservatism is no longer about caution. it&#8217;s a <strong>mechanism to justify privilege and power.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>iv. the aesthetics of conservatism</strong></p><p>as nietzsche said, <strong>&#8220;morals have aesthetic criteria.&#8221;</strong> so does conservatism.</p><p></p><p>&#8226; <strong>the golden age fallacy:</strong> every civilization believes things were better in the past. but were they?</p><p>&#8226; <strong>the beauty of familiarity:</strong> people trust what looks like what they&#8217;ve always known. change appears dangerous simply because it is unfamiliar.</p><p>&#8226; <strong>fear of the unknown:</strong> a man in chains fears freedom more than he resents captivity. captivity is predictable.</p><p></p><p><strong>v. the theological paradox: religion as a monument to conservatism</strong></p><p>there is no stronger enforcer of conservatism than <strong>religion.</strong> and perhaps no text embodies this better than <strong>the Bible </strong>&#8212;a book written in the context of iron age societies, codifying rules for a world that no longer exists<strong>.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>moral absolutism as a tool for control:</strong> in many faiths, what was dictated centuries ago is still upheld as if the world has remained unchanged<strong>.</strong> but if morality is eternal, why do societies no longer stone adulterers or enslave entire populations as biblical law once permitted?</p><p>&#8226; <strong>religion as inherited belief, not examined truth:</strong> most people do not arrive at their faith through introspection. they <strong>inherit it, absorb it, and defend it&#8212;</strong>not because it makes sense, but because it was given to them before they could question<strong>.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>fear disguised as righteousness:</strong> many cling to religious conservatism not because they deeply understand it, but because it absolves them of the burden of thinking outside its confines<strong>.</strong> it is easier to regurgitate scripture than to confront a world where truth is not absolute.</p><p>if religion was meant to be a guiding force for humanity, it should evolve alongside us. but it doesn&#8217;t&#8212;<strong>because its power lies in its permanence.</strong> change threatens not just belief but the institutions that profit from those beliefs.</p><p></p><p><strong>vi. resistance is futile</strong></p><p>despite all this, history moves in one direction: <strong>forward.</strong></p><p>&#8226; <strong>every rigid system collapses.</strong> monarchies, empires, theocracies&#8212;they all decay.</p><p>&#8226; <strong>even radicals become conservatives.</strong> marxists who wanted to destroy rigid capitalism built rigid communist states. religious reformers who rejected dogma built new dogmas.</p><p>&#8226; <strong>entropy is the only constant.</strong> conservatism is an illusion. the past is dead. the present is decaying. the future is inevitable.</p><p></p><p><strong>vii. what&#8217;s left to conserve?</strong></p><p>to be human is to exist between two impulses:</p><p>&#8226; the <strong>instinct to conserve</strong>&#8212;to preserve, to protect, to hold onto what we know.</p><p>&#8226; the <strong>impulse to progress</strong>&#8212;to challenge, to dismantle, to evolve.</p><p></p><p>but which is the anomaly? is progress unnatural, or is conservatism just fear in disguise? conservatives argue that stability is the default, and change is an anomaly. radicals argue that change is inevitable, and stability is an illusion.</p><p></p><p>it doesn&#8217;t matter. because in the end, <strong>change will come, whether we resist it or not.</strong></p><p>**</p><p><strong>current read:

the way you speak, the way you dress, the way you react when someone rudely shoves past you in a crowded room. do you bristle with indignation? brush it off with nonchalance? glare daggers in their direction? now, ask yourself&#8212;was this reaction a conscious decision, or was it programmed into you long before you had the awareness to resist it?</p><p>we like to believe we are the architects of our own identities, sculpting our personalities with deliberate precision. but strip away all external influences&#8212;societal expectations, parental conditioning, cultural dogma&#8212;what remains? does anything intrinsic to you still persist, untouched and untainted? or are we merely a sum of borrowed instincts and learned behaviors masquerading as individuality?</p><p></p><p><strong>the borrowed self</strong></p><p>from the moment of birth, we inherit an invisible script. before we can articulate thoughts, before we can even discern right from wrong, we are being shaped. our parents, our teachers, our environment&#8212;all of them conspire, consciously or otherwise, to instill in us a set of principles, biases, and limitations that we rarely pause to interrogate.</p><p>your accent? acquired.</p><p>your convictions? conditioned.</p><p>your aspirations? sculpted by expectation.</p><p>think about it&#8212;do you truly loathe public speaking, or did a childhood humiliation embed itself into your psyche, cementing a fear that has long since outlived its relevance? are you actually introverted, or did early rejection teach you that solitude was safer than seeking connection? do you <em>genuinely</em> hold the beliefs you champion, or are they merely echoes of voices that have long dictated your moral compass?</p><p>we accept our personalities as immutable facts, rarely questioning how much of what we claim as <em>ourselves</em> is merely an accumulation of external impositions.</p><p></p><p><strong>who would you be if nobody told you?</strong></p><p>imagine waking up in a world devoid of memory&#8212;no past experiences to define you, no societal script to follow, no parental voices whispering instructions in your subconscious. what would remain? what would you gravitate towards? what prejudices would you shed? what impulses would govern you if they weren&#8217;t filtered through years of social conditioning?</p><p>would you still believe in the same gods? would you still love the same kind of people? would you be more audacious, less restrained, or more indifferent to things you currently hold sacred?</p><p>there is something profoundly unsettling about this line of inquiry because it forces us to acknowledge that so much of what we accept as our <em>authentic selves</em> is, in reality, an arbitrary confluence of circumstances. yet, we move through life with an almost comical certainty in the rigidity of our own identities. we declare, <em>&#8220;this is just who i am,&#8221;</em> as though personality is a sculpted monolith rather than a pliable mosaic of influences.</p><p>but if you never chose these influences, if they were imposed upon you by chance and proximity, do they truly belong to you?</p><p></p><p><strong>the illusion of selfhood</strong></p><p>we are voracious collectors of labels. the intelligent one. the reserved one. the cynical one. the ambitious one. these monikers cling to us like second skin, reinforcing patterns of thought and behavior that we rarely question. but how much of these identities are self-determined, and how much of them have we unconsciously accepted because others imposed them upon us?</p><p>what if you aren&#8217;t inherently &#8220;bad with numbers&#8221; but were simply dismissed by an uninspired teacher in your youth? what if your so-called &#8220;laziness&#8221; is not a personality trait but a symptom of disillusionment in a system that offers you no real motivation? what if you were never naturally a &#8220;people pleaser&#8221; but merely learned, through a lifetime of subtle social reinforcements, that compliance is rewarded with acceptance?</p><p>and if all of this&#8212;your fears, your affinities, your very personality&#8212;is nothing more than a story you were handed, what happens when you decide to rewrite it?</p><p></p><p><strong>choosing who to be</strong></p><p>perhaps the self is not a discovery but a construction. perhaps authenticity isn&#8217;t about peeling back the layers to find some hidden, <em>truest</em> version of yourself but about the conscious curation of traits, discarding what no longer serves you and deliberately crafting what does.</p><p>because at the end of the day, you are not a finished masterpiece, but an evolving draft&#8212;revisable, reconfigurable, and entirely in your hands.</p><p>so i&#8217;ll ask again&#8212;who are you, really? and more importantly, who do you <em>choose</em> to be?</p><p></p><p>i wish you a great month.
