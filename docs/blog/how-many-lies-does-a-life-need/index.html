but underneath it is the fear that if we ever paused&#8212;truly paused&#8212;we&#8217;d see ourselves as we are, not as we hope to appear.</p><p>so we tell ourselves we are growing. even when we are circling.</p><p>even when we are rotting in elegant, well-lit spaces.</p><p>it is better to say &#8220;i am working on myself&#8221; than to admit &#8220;i am afraid of what i&#8217;ve become.&#8221;</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>the lie of goodness</strong></p><p></p><p>perhaps the most seductive lie of all is that we are good.</p><p>not because of what we&#8217;ve done, but because we feel like we are. we remember our intentions, not our impact. we recall the one time we gave, not the many times we turned away.</p><p>we believe our moods are justice.</p><p>if we feel bad after doing something wrong, surely that&#8217;s proof we&#8217;re moral.</p><p>but the truth is: most people are only as good as their consequences allow.</p><p>and in the absence of consequence, they become themselves.</p><p></p><p><strong>allegory: the house of necessary lies</strong></p><p></p><p>imagine a house.</p><p>each room is supported by a single lie.</p><p></p><p>the kitchen stands because someone believes they were loved.</p><p>the bedroom holds because someone believes they were chosen.</p><p>the study exists because someone believes they are intelligent.</p><p>and the front door only opens for those who believe they are safe.</p><p></p><p>now try removing one lie.</p><p>just one.</p><p>suddenly the roof buckles. the light flickers. the floor shifts.</p><p></p><p>you don&#8217;t live in a house.</p><p>you live in a compromise.</p><p></p><p>and that&#8217;s okay.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>the end of the lie</strong></p><p></p><p>what happens when the lie collapses?</p><p>sometimes clarity.</p><p>sometimes madness.</p><p>more often, silence.</p><p></p><p>people rarely scream when they lose a lie.</p><p>they just go quiet. they disappear from group chats.</p><p>they stare longer at their hands. they become slower to answer questions like &#8220;how are you?&#8221;</p><p>because now, they actually have to think.</p><p></p><p>the loss of a lie does not make you wise.</p><p>it makes you raw.</p><p>and if you&#8217;re not careful, it makes you cruel.</p><p></p><p>truth, without preparation, hardens.</p><p>and some people weaponize it not to heal&#8212;but to punish.</p><p></p><p>and so, the lie remains</p><p></p><p>this is not a call to radical honesty.</p><p>that too is a performance.</p><p>a new god dressed in sincerity.</p><p>another mask with sharper edges.</p><p></p><p>the question is not whether we lie.</p><p>we do. and we will.</p><p></p><p>the question is: which lies are worth keeping?</p><p>which ones hold the roof up?</p><p>which ones need to be buried with dignity, not shame?</p><p></p><p>because a life without lies is not brave.</p><p>it&#8217;s unlivable.</p></div> </article> <footer> <a href="https://obodugo.substack.com/p/how-many-lies-does-a-life-need" target="_blank" class="substack">Read on Substack ↗</a> <nav> <a href="/blog">← All essays</a> <a href="/">Home</a> </nav> </footer> </main>  </body> </html>
