principle.</strong></p><p>it was my last day of school&#8212;at least, what was supposed to be.</p><p>i had decided to drop out. not because i couldn&#8217;t keep up, but because the entire system felt <strong>too slow. </strong>rigid. mechanical. the stop-and-start pace of school frustrated me. i wanted <strong>depth, speed, intensity.</strong>no waiting for the rest of the class to catch up. no teachers dictating what knowledge mattered.</p><p>so i left.</p><p>studying alone wasn&#8217;t a problem. in fact, i thrived in it.</p><p>but then, on my way home, i stumbled across something that stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>a small, nondescript building. a blackboard visible through the window.</p><p>inside, a man stood at the board, chalk moving in broad, confident strokes.</p><p></p><p>three words<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>archimedes&#8217; principle.</strong></p><p>i stopped.</p><p></p><p>the students inside weren&#8217;t slouched in disinterest, staring at the clock, waiting for freedom. <strong>they were alive.</strong> arguing, debating, leaning in.</p><p></p><p>and at the center of it all stood <strong>him.</strong></p><p>uncle festus.</p><p>tall, sharp-eyed, with a presence that filled the room, he wasn&#8217;t just explaining a concept&#8212;<strong>he was unraveling it.</strong> physics wasn&#8217;t something to be memorized; it was something to be <strong>felt.</strong></p><p>i stood there for a long time, watching. something inside me clicked.</p><p><strong>this was what i had been missing.</strong></p><p>i loved learning alone.</p><p>but <strong>learning with others?</strong> racing, competing, pushing each other past our limits?</p><p><strong>that was something else entirely.</strong></p><p>i turned and walked home, but i already knew&#8212;<strong>i was coming back.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>and i did.</strong></p><p></p><p>uncle festus didn&#8217;t run a school. not in any formal sense.</p><p>his &#8220;classroom&#8221; was his house, his &#8220;students&#8221; a ragtag group of high school dropouts, restless minds who had abandoned the standard path because it didn&#8217;t move fast enough.</p><p>and under his roof, we moved fast.</p><p>we studied for <strong>ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day.</strong></p><p>math, physics, chemistry, engineering&#8212;we weren&#8217;t bound by subjects, we devoured <strong>everything.</strong>textbooks piled on the floor, equations sprawled across walls, our voices bouncing off the ceiling as we argued over problems that most students wouldn&#8217;t touch with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>uncle festus had <strong>one rule:</strong></p><p><strong>if you can&#8217;t keep up, you get left behind.</strong></p><p>there was no <em>let&#8217;s go over this again for the slow ones at the back.</em> no pandering, no sugarcoating. if you didn&#8217;t understand something, it wasn&#8217;t his job to slow down. <strong>it was your job to catch up.</strong></p><p></p><p>we had a saying&#8212;<strong>only the strong survive.</strong></p><p>and we meant it.</p><p><strong>the competition was brutal.</strong></p><p></p><p>no one was there to hold your hand. if you wanted to be the best, you had to fight for it.</p><p></p><p>ejike was my greatest rival.</p><p>if he solved a problem before me, i seethed. if he grasped a concept faster, i tore through it until i understood it <strong>twice as deeply.</strong></p><p>we weren&#8217;t learning for exams. we weren&#8217;t learning for approval.</p><p><strong>we were learning because we had to.</strong></p><p>because knowledge, <strong>real knowledge,</strong> was its own kind of warfare.</p><p><strong>sundays were no exception.</strong></p><p>i&#8217;d wake up, go to church, sit through the sermon, nod at the appropriate moments, then the second we got home&#8212;<strong>i was gone.</strong></p><p>straight to uncle festus&#8217; place.</p><p>if i had a life outside of that room, <strong>i don&#8217;t remember it.</strong></p><p>and frankly, <strong>i didn&#8217;t care.</strong></p><p>because in that space, <strong>i was alive.</strong></p><p><strong>but uncle festus wasn&#8217;t just a teacher.</strong></p><p><strong>he was a decipherer of minds.</strong></p><p>there were days when i would sit, staring at a problem, drowning in frustration, feeling like the numbers and symbols were <strong>conspiring against me.</strong></p><p>then he&#8217;d walk over, glance at my work, and smirk.</p><p><strong>&#8220;you&#8217;re thinking too hard.&#8221;</strong></p><p>and in minutes, he would unravel the entire thing.</p><p><strong>not by giving me the answer.</strong></p><p>but by forcing me to <strong>see.</strong></p><p>it wasn&#8217;t magic.</p><p><strong>it was clarity.</strong></p><p>and clarity is a rare thing in this world.</p><p>uncle festus didn&#8217;t just teach physics.</p><p><strong>he made you feel it.</strong></p><p>he turned numbers into <strong>narratives,</strong> formulas into <strong>stories.</strong></p><p>he made me realize that the universe wasn&#8217;t just something you lived in&#8212;<strong>it was something you could understand.</strong></p><p><strong>and once you understood it, you could bend it to your will.</strong></p><p><strong>so when my screen flashed that question&#8212;</strong></p><p><em>&#8220;who has been the most impactful person in your life, and how did they influence you?&#8221;</em></p><p>i didn&#8217;t hesitate.</p><p><strong>it was uncle festus.</strong></p><p>the man who turned learning into <strong>an obsession.</strong></p><p>who made knowledge feel like <strong>a battleground.</strong></p><p>who showed me that physics wasn&#8217;t just a subject&#8212;<strong>it was a way to see the world.</strong></p><p>and that, more than anything, is why he remains the most important person i&#8217;ve ever met.</p></div> <a href="https://obodugo.substack.com/p/uncle-festus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="substack-link">
