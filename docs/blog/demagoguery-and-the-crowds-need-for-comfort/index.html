begins with fatigue.</p><p>not in the body, but in the mind.</p><p></p><p>the kind of fatigue that sets in after years of hearing too much and understanding too little.</p><p>the kind that creeps up when nothing changes, when promises pile up like expired prescriptions, when language becomes a thing politicians use to decorate emptiness.</p><p>people grow tired of nuance. tired of process. tired of explanations.</p><p>they don&#8217;t want truth anymore. they want clarity.</p><p></p><p>and that&#8217;s where the demagogue enters. not as a villain. not as an outsider. but as an answer.</p><p>not the right answer. not even a real one.</p><p>just the kind that feels good in the moment.</p><p></p><p>he doesn&#8217;t need facts. he needs rhythm.</p><p>he doesn&#8217;t need integrity. he needs volume.</p><p>he doesn&#8217;t need to be correct. he just needs to be sure.</p><p></p><p>the people, by then, are not looking for leadership. they are looking for relief.</p><p></p><p>and the demagogue knows this.</p><p>he senses the weight in the room and offers a shortcut.</p><p>he packages rage and pain and nostalgia and hands it back to the people as policy.</p><p>he doesn&#8217;t ask for trust&#8212;he demands belief.</p><p>and belief, when untethered from scrutiny, is a very dangerous thing.</p><p></p><p>but here&#8217;s the real danger: he doesn&#8217;t rise alone.</p><p></p><p>the crowd builds him.</p><p>slowly. thoughtlessly.</p><p>with every shrug of &#8220;at least he&#8217;s doing something.&#8221;</p><p>with every deflection of &#8220;they&#8217;re all the same anyway.&#8221;</p><p>with every silence after a lie.</p><p>with every cheer for simplicity.</p><p>with every blind eye turned toward complexity because it takes too much effort to care.</p><p></p><p>this is not about any one man.</p><p>you want me to name names so you can outsource the blame.</p><p>but demagoguery is not about the speaker. it&#8217;s about the crowd that craves him.</p><p></p><p>we create the demagogue every time we trade understanding for emotional validation.</p><p>we summon him when we lose interest in cause and become obsessed with consequence.</p><p>we give him our platform, our faith, and our applause&#8212;not because he earned it, but because he said what we felt in a way we could finally chant.</p><p></p><p>this is how reason dies.</p><p>not with silence, but with roars.</p><p></p><p>we talk about misinformation, manipulation, fake news&#8212;things that distort reality.</p><p>but we rarely talk about how easy it is to be manipulated when you&#8217;ve already stopped thinking.</p><p>demagoguery doesn&#8217;t start with lies. it starts with a crowd that no longer wants the truth to be complicated.</p><p></p><p>and maybe you think you&#8217;re safe because you read. because you watch the right content. because you don&#8217;t shout on the street.</p><p>but the demagogue doesn&#8217;t need you to shout. he only needs you to sit still when it matters. to rationalize when he oversteps. to lower your standards just enough to say: &#8220;well, at least he&#8217;s better than the last.&#8221;</p><p></p><p>he doesn&#8217;t need your loyalty. he just needs your indifference.</p><p>the rest, the noise, the fire&#8212;he can generate on his own.</p><p></p><p>what frightens me isn&#8217;t the rise of a new kind of leader.</p><p>it&#8217;s the death of a certain kind of citizen.</p><p></p><p>the kind that pauses before clapping.</p><p>the kind that reads the fine print.</p><p>the kind that remembers history.</p><p>the kind that&#8217;s okay with not being entertained.</p><p>the kind that isn&#8217;t afraid to ask, how do i know what i know?</p><p></p><p>epistemology is not philosophy for the shelves. it&#8217;s survival.</p><p>because once you lose the thread of how you come to believe things, anyone can rewrite your values and hand them back to you with a new headline.</p><p></p><p>and maybe you think this is about nigeria. maybe you think it&#8217;s about your president. your governor. your senator.</p><p>but demagoguery is not a nationality. it&#8217;s not a region. it&#8217;s a human weakness. it&#8217;s what happens when people want to feel good more than they want to be right.</p><p></p><p>look at every empire that fell.</p><p>it didn&#8217;t start with a warlord.</p><p>it started with applause.</p><p></p><p>a tired people. a charismatic man.</p><p>a vague promise.</p><p>a shared enemy.</p><p>and the collapse of critical thought.</p><p></p><p>we&#8217;ve seen this before.</p><p>the names change. the costumes change. but the script is ancient.</p><p></p><p>and still, every generation thinks they&#8217;re the exception.</p><p>they think they can have it both ways: a strong man and a free state.</p><p>emotion-driven leadership and rational governance.</p><p>mass appeal and institutional integrity.</p><p></p><p>they think they can shout their way into justice.</p><p></p><p>but the truth is quieter.</p><p>and the truth rarely wins elections.</p><p></p><p>the demagogue always has the better story.</p><p>he speaks in plot twists, not policy.</p><p>he offers belonging without introspection.</p><p>and that is why he wins.</p><p></p><p>not because he is brilliant.</p><p>but because we have stopped asking questions.</p><p></p><p>we assume, retweet, nod.</p><p>we follow the man who speaks our anger, even if he misuses it.</p><p>we defend him because his enemies annoy us.</p><p>we make excuses for him because his failures feel familiar.</p><p>and slowly, we forget how to think outside his frame.</p><p></p><p>this is the real tragedy: not that one man has too much power,</p><p>but that millions have surrendered their ability to recognize when power is being abused.</p><p></p><p>so no, i will not give you a name.</p><p>because the name is irrelevant.</p><p>what matters is whether you see yourself in this crowd.</p><p>what matters is whether you&#8217;ve already clapped too many times without knowing why.</p><p>what matters is whether you still remember what it feels like to think alone&#8212;without needing your side to agree with you.</p><p></p><p>the demagogue will always rise.</p><p>but he only wins when thinking becomes uncomfortable.</p><p>when doubt becomes elitism.</p><p>when silence becomes loyalty.</p><p>when cheering becomes more important than checking.</p><p></p><p>so if you&#8217;re clapping, pause.</p><p>if you&#8217;re sure, reflect.</p><p>and if you&#8217;re angry at this, good.</p><p>maybe you&#8217;re still alive.</p><p>not everything loud deserves an audience.</p><p></p><p>ekene dili chukwu.</p></div> </article> <footer> <a href="https://obodugo.substack.com/p/demagoguery-and-the-crowds-need-for"
