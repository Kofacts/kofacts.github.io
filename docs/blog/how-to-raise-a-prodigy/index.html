ancestry? a trick of circumstance?</p><p>more urgently: if i ever have a child, could i build the kind of world where brilliance becomes possible?</p><p></p><p>i should say it plainly: i&#8217;m no parent.</p><p>no lineage yet extends from me.</p><p>i write only as someone who was once permitted the rare grace to wonder &#8212; to be &#8212; without too much interference.</p><p>through the reading of lives, and the slow accumulation of patterns, certain suspicions have begun to take shape.</p><p></p><p>i offer no answers.</p><p>only provocations, stitched together with admiration and a certain uneasy hope.</p><p></p><p><strong>1. perhaps the shaping begins before the first breath.</strong></p><p>it is not fashionable to say it, but nature is rarely democratic.</p><p>pattern recognition, restless curiosity, a mind quick to assemble meaning &#8212; these are not gifted equally.</p><p>yet even rare endowments, left without nurture, rot quietly in the soil.</p><p><code>nature hands you the instrument.</code></p><p><code>whether you ever play it is another story.</code></p><p></p><p><strong>2. perhaps the spark is never taught &#8212; only caught.</strong></p><p>prodigies are not manufactured by instruction.</p><p>they are immersed.</p><p>their childhoods are not battlegrounds of grades and compliance, but vast territories of ideas, mechanisms, mysteries.</p><p>they are abandoned &#8212; lovingly &#8212; in fields where thought is abundant, and left to wander, to break, to rebuild.</p><p><code>you cannot push a mind into flight.</code></p><p><code>you can only arrange the air.</code></p><p></p><p><strong>3. perhaps boredom is a necessary violence.</strong></p><p>in a world that murders silence with every flicker of a screen, true boredom is becoming a lost art.</p><p>but it is inside long, uncomfortable stretches of emptiness that the mind is forced inward &#8212; where invention first shows its teeth.</p><p>prodigies are not entertained into existence.</p><p>they are forged in hunger.</p><p><code>boredom is not the enemy.</code></p><p><code>it is the birthplace.</code></p><p></p><p><strong>4. perhaps children do not obey instruction &#8212; only atmosphere.</strong></p><p>no speech about the virtues of learning will move a child.</p><p>they follow the ambient weather of your soul.</p><p>if you live anesthetized, dulled by repetition, no exhortation will save them.</p><p>if you wrestle openly with ideas, if you hunger audibly, they will catch the fever.</p><p><code>curiosity cannot be commanded.</code></p><p><code>it must be witnessed.</code></p><p></p><p><strong>5. perhaps asymmetry is the mark, not the flaw.</strong></p><p>the lives i admire are jagged.</p><p>a child who can dismantle a radio at eight may forget to tie his shoes at ten.</p><p>a teenager who dreams in music may recoil from arithmetic.</p><p>the urge to balance them &#8212; to correct the wildness &#8212; is understandable.</p><p>and fatal.</p><p><code>the gardener prunes roses.</code></p><p><code>he does not lecture lightning.</code></p><p></p><p><strong>6. perhaps even then, it is never truly ours to command.</strong></p><p>you could build the forge, protect the silences, model the hunger &#8212; and the fire may still refuse to come.</p><p>genius remains sovereign.</p><p>it consents, or it withholds.</p><p><code>you can build the stage.</code></p><p><code>you cannot summon the gods.</code></p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>the dream is not to manufacture extraordinary lives.</p><p>it is to build a house where such lives could be born &#8212; and where, if they are not, a quieter greatness still finds room to breathe.</p><p></p><p>in a world so hostile to silence, to slowness, to thought itself &#8212;</p><p>to have merely preserved the conditions for greatness may itself be a kind of miracle.</p></div> <a href="https://obodugo.substack.com/p/how-to-raise-a-prodigy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="substack-link">
